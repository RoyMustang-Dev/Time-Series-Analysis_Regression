## ${\color{cyan}1.\ Problem \ Statement:}$
### ${\color{darkgray}Predict \ the \ sales \ price \ of \ Bulldozers, \ given \ a \ Time-Series \ Dataset}$
&nbsp;

## ${\color{cyan}2.\ Dataset \ Info:}$
### ${\color{darkgray}The \ dataset \ has \ been \ downloaded \ from \ }$[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview)
&nbsp;

* ### ${\color{darkgray}Since \ we \ already \ have \ a \ dataset, \ we'll \ approach \ the \ problem \ with \ the \ following \ machine \ learning \ modelling \ framework.}$
